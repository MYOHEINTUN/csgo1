                <h2><b>Introduction:</b></h2>
                <p>
                    Counter-Strike: Global Offensive or CS:GO is a 5v5 Competitive fps game, the gameplay is classic and not that realistic, graphics are decent but no one care about them since all players aim for higher frame rates by lowering resolution & graphics settings to take the best advantages over the other players.
                    It took me 600+ hours to convince myself that this game is killing my mental health and it's not worth my time at all, sure I had a lot of fun sometimes (I mean who doesn't know the feeling when you are getting most of the kills and your friends shout with your name everytime you clutch an impossible round) but the negatives were more than the positives.
                </p>
                <h2><b>Gameplay:</b></h2>
                <p>
                    NOTE: I'll only talk about the competitive side of the game because it's the most played playlist and the reason why you shouldn't buy this game.
                    There are two teams, Counter-Terrorists and Terrorists, CTs play the defenders role and Ts play the attackers role in Bomb Maps (roles are switched in Hostage Maps).
                    The match can reach 30 rounds (15-15) which is a tie, and if one of the teams win 16 rounds they win the match, CTs win the round when they kill all the Ts, defuse the bomb (or rescue a hostage) and when Ts run out of time before
                </p>
                <h2><b>Prime And Non-Prime:</b></h2>
                <p>
                    If you are planning to play this game no matter what I say in this review do me a favor and just buy it, Non-Prime is unplayable, there are a lot of cheaters and VAC just doesn't work, also there is no ranked feature for free users, the game used to give them access to Prime after reaching level 21 but laws has changed and there is no point from Free to Play Competitive game without a goal (Rank to achieve). <br>
                    NOTE: Prime doesn't mean you will not meet with any cheater, no it just decreases the chances of meeting with one.

                I had a girlfriend before I played this game, but after I downloaded this game, I received a phone call from her saying she found a new person and was leaving me. I was devastated. So I started grinding on this game 24/7. It became natural for me. I couldn't put this game down. I sold my brother on eBay just for money to buy skins. Eventually I played so much till my fingers fell off. Then my hands fell off. My arms and legs came off next. Next thing I knew, I was just a human chicken nugget. I still play this game every single day for a minimum of 25 hours a day and play with my tongue on my keyboard and my belly button on the mouse.
